# Intermediate SQL Tutorial Notes

# SQL COUNT

## Write a query to count the number of non-null rows in the low column.

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(low) AS count_low
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
```

## Write a query that determines counts of every single column. Which column has the most null values?

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(date) AS count_date,
       COUNT(year) AS count_year,
       COUNT(month) AS count_month,
       COUNT(open) AS count_open,
       COUNT(high) AS count_high,
       COUNT(low) AS count_low,
       COUNT(close) AS count_close,
       COUNT(volume) AS count_volume,
       COUNT(id) AS count_id
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price

-- column high has the most null values
```

# SQL SUM

## Write a query to calculate the average opening price (hint: you will need to use both COUNT and SUM, as well as some simple arithmetic.).

```{sql}
SELECT SUM(open) / COUNT(open) AS avg_open
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
```

# SQL MIN/MAX

## What was Apple's lowest stock price (at the time of this data collection)?

```{sql}
SELECT MIN(low) AS min_low
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
```

## What was the highest single-day increase in Apple's share value?

```{sql}
SELECT MAX(close - open) AS max_increase
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
```

# SQL AVG
